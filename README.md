# misc-unfinished
Various projects of mine that have been put on indefinite hiatus.

Every project here is being uploaded as-is — in the state that each was left in before development halted. I recognize now that poor programming practice is evident in much of this older work, but I'm leaving everything here in such a state for posterity and as a record of my growth as an engineer.

## SettleSim
This was to be a primarily text-based god game written in Lua for the LÖVE Engine.

## LiteDungeon DungeonGenerator
This is a nearly-complete dungeon generation algorithm that I wrote in Lua for Roblox and using the Roblox API.

## SOMNAM: Prologue
This was a game I started working on early in the pandemic. Development started in the LÖVE Engine. I would later move the project to Godot Engine.
