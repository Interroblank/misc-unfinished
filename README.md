# misc-unfinished
Various projects of mine that have been put on indefinite hiatus.

Every project here is uploaded in the state that each was left in before development halted. I recognize now that poor programming practice is evident in much of this older work, but I'm leaving everything here in such a state for posterity and as a record of my growth as an engineer.

## SettleSim
This was to be a primarily text-based god game written in Lua for the LÖVE Engine.

## LiteDungeon DungeonGenerator
This was a nearly-complete dungeon generation algorithm that I wrote in Lua using the Roblox API.

## SOMNAM: Prologue
This was a game I started working on in early 2020.

Development started in the LÖVE Engine before moving to Godot.
